All right, yeah, so a couple of other quick announcements before I go over what today's class session is going to look like. This is no longer relevant.\n",
      " to the first assignment, but just a heads up, I gather a lot of students don't realize this, if you submit any assignment more than three days after the deadline, it's a good idea to just email your prof to let them know you've done so. We get notifications that an assignment hasn't been turned in, but only for the first three days. And after that, I have no idea, did the student turn it in?\n",
      " did or is it still outstanding? So I appreciate it. I imagine your other profs would appreciate it too. Third, Ola, our TA, has offered to hold a Zotero workshop for anyone interested. So put up a check if you would be potentially interested in Ola putting that together.\n",
      " Okay. All right. Yeah. Good. Great. Fourth, I mentioned on Tuesday that I was maybe going to testify at an asylum hearing. I'm proud to say that the person won asylum, which is an extra big deal under the current administration in the U.S. So really good news. I had another hearing yesterday where I didn't have to testify, but I'm still waiting to hear back.\n",
      " about that. Lastly, if you are interested in learning more about the asylum process, how an academic like me can contribute, we cover this in the first few weeks of the Migration and Borders tutorial, which I will be teaching next spring. And just in general, for M26s, tutorial lottery will go out at the same time as the regular course lottery sometime next week.\n",
      " busy figuring that out. And thank you for those of you who have been engaging with me throughout the tutorial selection process. Great. So today's class is going to focus on the historical evolution of how we've occupied space and land and what this means about who we are and how we live. So to engage with this topic we'll be looking at the concept of cities over time.\n",
      " We'll first have an extended debrief about the themes and concepts explained in the pre-class readings, and then you'll have a chance to work in breakouts to compare and contrast your possible LBA sites and how you might address localization in your assignment. Throughout these activities, you'll become familiar with how spatial forms of the built environment can spread globally, how this also spreads social ideas and ways of life, and how these typologies and morphologies\n",
      " transform with local conditions. I'm going to do the thing that I say profs shouldn't do and not let you talk before having you start the prep poll.

And throughout the discussion, think about how these ideas and concepts, as well as development in the history of urban environments, are illustrated or not in your potential LBA sites, because I'll be asking you about this in the reflection poll. I also want you to think about the relationship between urbanization and shifts in hashtag social order. I'm actually going to go ahead and put a couple of our most important LOs forth to the day.\n",
      " today here at the bottom. All right, let's return to the poll. Robson, according to the assigned readings, what factors were most important in encouraging the rise of cities? Yeah, my answer, I put like four main reasons. I think that the first one is the agriculture surplus. So all the cities start to be developed around like agriculture developed\n",
      " because the population could be like concentrated. They could provide like enough food for everyone. We started to have like labor specialization and also the beginning of trade. Then we had like a big impact of like rivers providing like fertile lands and transport routes. We also had like political development with...\n",
      " governance. And finally, like recently, the capitalism and industrialization, also creating like tech hubs. And yeah. Yeah, that we're gonna come to that, you know, that last piece in just a moment. But good job getting us started. I know I didn't quite put it out in the four item order that you said, but hopefully I covered everything. If not, Robson, go ahead and please put in\n",
      " any items that I missed. And yeah, are there any other reasons that folks talked about for the rise of cities? Yeah, Alen. One important factor is that this like early cities were very.\n",
      " strategically positioned with respect to trade routes, and they have control of the resources. So cities somewhat emerged as strategic trade hubs. And by the fact that they were positioned in these strategic hubs, they somewhat integrating like distinct economies and fostering this long distance trading. Yeah, good. Elena, what would you?\n",
      " add to that? Yeah, hand in hand with a rise of trade, rise of technology, which is because the diffusion of ideas, of course, comes with trade. Yeah, good. And we might talk about that relative to labor specialization as well. Sherry, any other points that you want to cover? Oh, I just also wanted to mention the technology and industrial advancements in terms of the city's rise, because the kind of\n",
      " create more job opportunities and also draw people from the rural areas to the city. Yeah, good. We might also think, and here Ellen's point about sort of strategic position comes in the military element, right, that cities become sort of valuable, it's become easier to protect and more necessary to protect as well. All right, let's turn then to just\n",
      " sort of, I think this is the farthest moment back in like human history that we go in the entire historical forces track. So let's fast forward a few centuries. So Hilary, what would you describe as the links between capitalism and urbanization? So I think for capitalism, we value a lot like efficiency. So I think efficiency is something that brings like\n",
      " people to reconsider how to construct the space and city in a more efficient way. For example, the concept of global cities, how you concentrate financial innovation or all the financial things within hubs and how different places connect to each other. Also, for trade, how\n",
      " like the transportation network would work like that also is like like also is in parallel with the rise or like the advancement in technology. Yeah all right good so that and that's maybe you know it's gonna change over time but it's interesting to think about this search for rationalization it's taking different forms in different eras.\n",
      " Good. All right, Faye, what are some other ways we can connect the history of urbanization to the history of capitalism? I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for, but there was definitely an emphasis on the role of empires as they have sort of risen and fallen in the last couple of centuries, in that relationship that they had to cities, because cities, as Alain sort of said,\n",
      " act as a strategic position for trade but also politically. It's the place where you can put your leaders, it can be a regulatory hub, it was often a jurisdiction that required tribute or tax or something like this. And so a lot of that I think is underlined by the rise of capitalism and sort of the desire for the expansion of empires with these sort of cities seen as the center of them. Yeah good and we can think about sort of\n",
      " both sides of the imperial relationship, right? Both the sort of ways in which empire and capitalism contributed to the consolidation of the imperial metropole, but then also how it contributed to the rise of colonial capitals as well. Good, I think that's an underappreciated piece. And we can, as we have done at several points throughout the semester, we can tell a really nice global story about that.\n",
      " All right, Adam, what are some, maybe another way, focusing less on maybe the colonial situation and more on cities in Europe and the Americas? In what ways is capitalism implicated in the rise of those cities? I think we talked about efficiency, so sure.\n",
      " rationalization, empires. I think the next thing would be the easy access to the trade, to the people, the networks, the businesses, like cities create this. Still, it ties back to the efficiency point.\n",
      " also like the interconnectedness within a city. Yeah, good. So we've touched on a bunch of ways on trade. You're sort of branching out into another area. I was gonna say something else, but Hilary, I'll let you come in first. So something else that I think is like, because of capitalism, like people, like in rural areas, they would want to, you know, like get more income. So they would move to cities and like this.\n",
      " like kind of like my like movement of people also kind of like leads to like rural places without the talent to actually develop and like a lot of talents going to the cities make it like even more city-like or more developed. Yeah, good. So one funny thing, I don't think I've talked about this this semester, maybe I have, I know it's come up a couple times in AH152. Does anyone know what?\n",
      " within the field of demography, what the definition of an urban area is, it's an area, it's a settlement with more than 2,000 people. So, which is really kind of astonishing that, you know, like, by that definition, I mean, there are other definitions, but by that definition, the city of 70,000 people where I live is a city the same way New York.\n",
      " is an urban settlement the same way New York City, which is a population 10 times or 100 times as large, is. So yeah, this is a good observation. But let's also think about sort of, we're not just talking about, when we're talking about urban, it's not necessarily a big city. It can be a mid-sized town. We think about the changes in some of the dynamics that happen.\n",
      " there. All right, but to bridge Adam's point and Hillary's point, this is going to facilitate this increasing concentration of people and industrial production, as Robson raised at the beginning, that's going to allow employers to control the workforce, right? So it's encouraging when we get to sort of the period of industrial capitalism by the 18th, 19th century,\n",
      " it's going to be beneficial for the efficiency reasons for employers to build factories there, and you're going to have what Marx called the reserve army of labor. Jobless workers, many of them have come from the city, who are available to work for you. All right, yeah, Jinggen, go ahead. So when we talk about how capitalism is kind of enhanced,\n",
      " the urbanization, what are we kind of contrasting against? Is it communism and then how is it still, like how is it not having the factories? Is it because they're less controlled over the decisions? Yeah, no, that's a really good, really good observation that we're not just talking about sort of a capitalist\n",
      " modernity here, that we could, this is a story we could tell for socialism too, particularly in the 20th century. So maybe we could talk about industrialization more broadly rather than capitalism specifically. Is that a satisfactory answer? No, it's a really, really good question and we'll come back to this point in a few weeks.\n",
      " in a discussion about human-caused climate change. All right, so as a result of all these factors that we've just been describing, we can start to talk about the role of urban planners as we get towards the 20th century. So Carl, what prompted the rise of modernist utopian urban planning in the early 20th century?\n",
      " century. Hello, hello. Can you hear me all right? Yep. I would say one quick evidence I could point to was this portion of the reading where it mentioned how if you lived in Massachusetts, in Boston specifically, your life expectancy would be below seven years compared to those who\n",
      " lived in the rural areas and I think that's one solid piece of evidence I can point to where people slowly started realizing that oh might be because of the environment we're living in because I forgot who mentioned it ah Friedrich Friedrich when he was talking about Manchester talked about the living conditions of the working class and how it was like basically tenderloin like but 10x worse and so\n",
      " being informed by history, I suppose, this field of urban planning rose to sort of counter that, and then emerged the philosophies of different scholars. Yeah, great. All right. So, Jules, let's touch on some of the figures we've got covered here. So, yeah, Ebenezer Howard, thought of as the first\n",
      " professional planner. What was his vision? This has been a subject in chat already, I think. I think it was the one with like the green towns or like the green cities where you have like sort of like independent communities and then they are like surrounded by green belts. Something I wanted to bring in like and I'll put it in chat but I think it's so interesting like in the German class, like in my literature classes, we looked at\n",
      " like expressionist poems from the early 20th century and they are all like expressing like sort of like the the hard living conditions in the city and sort of like the lack of those like green spaces and sort of like the the narrowness and like the the depressive like like so like depressive conditions like it's it's so like guys like I if you if you understand like I recommend reading them it's like my favorite poems of all time.\n",
      " And I think this is actually like an interesting counter sort of like what Howard's trying to do against sort of like those very like narrow, dark, like machine-like living conditions, sort of like bringing back sort of like the nature and the liveliness in those green zones. Did we lose the prof?\n",
      " I know, I guess it gave you more time to rant.\n",
      " All right. Sorry about that. Look on my internet connection. Dropped for a minute. Can you hear me now? Yeah. All right. Great. Yeah. So, Jules, I think a great example talking about these poems. And yeah, you know, in some ways that would have made a great primer.\n",
      " source to talk about for the first assignment. That would have been a super cool one. All right, good. So let's move on through the list. Try to move chronologically. So Takaya, what then was the Chicago School's vision for urban reform? Yeah, so I think\n",
      " I think it talks about, in short, it approaches the urban planning from an ecological perspective, trying to approach it more academically, talking about how we can view the cities as natural ecosystems where different people from different backgrounds or different groups of people live together.\n",
      " separating spaces, and then I think it introduces the idea of zoning. Yeah, good. Yeah. All right, yes, people from different backgrounds. Right, so, you know, figure of Chicago early 20th century, a lot of European immigrants, people coming in from different parts of Europe. Good, anything else?\n",
      " anyone wants to tack on for what the Chicago School looked at. Let me switch the layout here, just make things a little more manageable. Right, yeah, so it's sort of, I think, building on that point about the ecosystem, they really saw cities as sort of evolving space.\n",
      " spatially over time, which was a major switch in social science in this early part of the 20th century. All right. Elaine, I'm going to butcher his name, maybe the most famous planner on here, Le Corbusier. What was his vision? I missed him.\n",
      " Sorry, I'll have to call a friend for help. All right, Alan's stepping in. So the group that's here was this modernist architect. And they envisioned structuring the cities based on some sort of rational design and functional zoning. One of the key concepts was, oh.\n",
      " Radiant City, if I'm not mistaken, by reading on my notes And in advocated that like for like high-rise residential towers surrounded by open green areas and Designed to maximize life, air, and efficiency, so very functional And also in this spirit of functionality They propose separating living, working, and leisure spaces to reduce the\n",
      " congestion and all of that. Yes, good. And we can see how that's in some ways piggybacking on some of these earlier trends in planning, right? Good, all right. So, Ibby, then we come to Jane Jacobs. How does she compare to Le Corbusier? Okay, so basically Jane Jacobs and\n",
      " urban activist, challenged basically this top-down sort of urban planning approach of these figures like Le Corbusier. She opposed large-scale urban renewal projects that demolished traditional neighborhoods and she favored more sterile, car-centric developments. She emphasized the importance of street-level interactions and natural surveillance to foster safe, lively neighborhoods and advocated for neighborhoods that sort of mixed residential, cultural, and environmental.\n",
      " commercial spaces to foster local economies and strong communities and unlike you know and focus really much more on bottom-up planning and like you know just argued for grassroots urban planning that actually prioritize the need of residents. Yes great yeah so of all the planners and scholars we're looking at here these are the these last two are the most opposed to\n",
      " one another. And yeah, Jane Jacobs is always a great read. The Courvoisier's designs are beautiful, but they're missing something. They're missing a human element that she helps us think through and bring out. All right, let's... I don't know how to call it. Jules, your comment in...\n",
      " about how I miss said fast-forward or whatever I did before has me a little bit confused here. All right, what connections does Sasson's conception of the global city emphasize and what does this framing of cities you think tend to neglect? So in other words...\n",
      " what are the benefits, sort of the central points and then the limitations of the idea of the global city? Yeah, Hilary. I think it has a very strong, like emphasis on like interconnectness between different like global financial hubs. And obviously like a lot, like, because like how they define a global cities based on like\n",
      " like kind of like financial contribution and not financial but like yeah like based on like the financial status so like that that means there's like a very strong like emphasis on that and that like like kind of inevitably show like there's this like inequity between like incomes between like different hubs around the world and so there's also because of this strong\n",
      " like, focus in finance and economics, then there's less emphasis on, like, culture or, like, history in different places. And because of, like, this interconnectedness, like, we also focus more on the global level, but less on, like, the local level. Yeah, great. So this is a very strong example of a global, of hashtag global past, both in the potential benefits and the potential shortcomings of...\n",
      " of that high level of analysis. Adam. Some of the critique, I think it was that it focused too much on the like economic and all of these aspects but it ignores, for example, the colonial history. It ignores other important aspects of global cities. It was too much focus.\n",
      " focus on efficiency, and I think the point that we brought up, which is industrialization, you know, capitalism. Yeah. Good. All right. So, Sherry, talking about sort of capitalism, urbanization in the 1990s, also brings us to David Harvey. So how does he conceptualize of the historical relationship between capitalism, technology, and spatial change? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. \n",
      " Yeah, definitely. I think one point he mentioned in terms of the relationship between capitalism and technology is that in the years when the technology are kind of viralizing at the moment, it is the capitalism kind of catalyzed, like accelerated development of technology. And\n",
      " investment, large amount of investment into technology industry, the kind of size of the capitalism kind of quickly spread across the globe. So I think that's one central point. And I think what's interesting about this is kind of, this is a feedback loop, but we are thinking about the relationship between technology and capitalism. Yeah. Good. All right. \n",
      " these two points in conjunction, Faye, the global city and Harvey's idea of the spatial fix, territorialization of capitalism, to what extent do you think global cities characterize a distinctly new phenomenon or is this a narrative we can place in the 1990s specifically? So in other words, is it more productive to think about these two?\n",
      " theorists in reference to Historicity 1 or in reference to Historicity 2? I think I was with you until you drew it to the distinction between Historicity 1 and 2. Can you explain to me a little bit how the two sort of parts of that question tie together? Well, why don't you answer the first part as far as you understood it?\n",
      " and then we'll come to hystericity one, hystericity two. Okay, so what I understand about the first question is, putting these two things together, should we see global cities as something that's arisen more recently, or is it something we can trace back to, like can we say that these two theorists are kind of talking about a similar phenomenon? I would say that the two theorists probably want to talk about something very similar, and\n",
      " maybe the kinds of tools or technologies and some of the social and financial phenomenon that underlie things since the 90s have changed, like the things that Harvey is talking about on you in some ways, and I wonder about how we might think about even more recent phenomenons like the COVID-19 pandemic and how that might have changed the way that we think about global connectedness and the role of cities, like we I think M26 showed up to a very\n",
      " empty San Francisco in 2022 after the end of the pandemic because the role of that city had changed in many ways as a result of the pandemic and so I think they kind of they want to be talking about some of the things like the phenomenons are different but the this core idea of global connectedness via these hubs and that that finance and technology and innovation is at the center of that it is the same I think okay yeah good you got anything you'd add to that\n",
      " Yeah, I think so. Also, like, in terms of the historicity, one or two, I feel like it's more like the two, because it's about, we get to, they get to like narrate about this like a dream, almost global city, right? And then it became\n",
      " more like an appeal, like aspiration for the series to develop towards like this regulating fiction, I think they used the word. And then, but like, we don't know if this actually was the case and then we just get to see the change. So right now also like, it's hard to see if they achieved the actual series, but also that the narration keep changing.\n",
      " the class of the city itself. Yeah, great. So this really brings us to the five Cs and what we sort of want to privilege. Are we looking at more recent changes or, Faye, to your point, like are there these other trends and patterns that are more marked by continuity, even as we see sort of technological advancement picking up? This is also bringing in, I love COVID as an example.\n",
      " example of contingency, right? So how do we weigh causality and contingency in explaining sort of the way we see the world today? We had a great conversation about this in AH152 this week. Adam? Let me know if I go too far on a tangent, but this is another point I think of contingency that I debated with someone else.\n",
      " I like the COVID example. I also think of tribes and communities in Africa and how colonization and capitalism and industrialization brought so many technologies, maybe accelerated the way that they communicate. But is that like the best? I think this is tying back to the idea of aspiration.\n",
      " the over-idealizing the global city. So I think they can communicate it in a way that I think when people colonize, and I think we set up some sort of standard that we think, looking back at the past, they were disconnected, but maybe they were connected. We have like this other standard of, oh, they need to have instant telecommunication right now.\n",
      " So, that's also another contingency point. Right, great. So, as Conrad talks about, Faye, this comes back to your point, globalization is not just a story of the 1990s, right? It gained more emphasis and interest then because of these technological changes. But in fact, these points of connection, these mobilities, Adam, as you are highlighting, really do date back earlier. So, a great question to ask, okay, is, am I looking at?\n",
      " is it Historicity I or is it Historicity II? That is, am I seeing more of, is this a narrative about the past that I can sort of explain the origins of, or is it really sort of defining something that was happening, you know, actually happening more in the past? There's always an element, Historicity I and Historicity II. Trio tells us we can't perfectly deconstruct either one, but do, I think,\n",
      " to my question here about historicity one and two, as Ching-En was saying, Faye, as you answered as well, Sasson and Harvey's ideas can really be seen in it through a historicity, profitably through a historicity two lens. All right, let's talk about the remittance landscape. Elena, what is this and what social and economic processes does it represent? Remittance is when someone goes away.\n",
      " abroad, migrates, for example, like a Mexican migrant, as it said in the reading, to the US, and then would send home money that they're earning, especially in surplus, and sending home to the family. So remittance landscape refers to the type of projects that are built across these small increments of money being sent from abroad. Yeah, good. All right. And Takaya, how is this an example of hashtag glocalization? Like how could we use a remittance...\n",
      " a house built with remittance money as a site for the LBA? Yeah, I think so like the house like the built with remittance money usually like represents like like Shows the influence on like foreign like foreign architectural style. For example, even if it's like the example with the\n",
      " Mexican migrants, they might have some US architectural style reflected there, so it might deviate from the ordinary local style there. Then we'll see the mixture of how it's going to be integrated into a local culture or local architecture. And then sometimes the effect is so huge that it kind of overrides the local culture, and then it kind of dominates the local.\n",
      " architecture. Awesome, yeah, so we can imagine finding a house or a neighborhood that exemplifies this and really applying hashtag critique, right, analyzing sort of elements of the house, how can we can relate them to local styles versus global styles. So great job with that. All right, yeah, I know this discussion is a little bit different from a lot of the other ones we've had throughout the semester, but great job with the readings.\n",
      " wrap it up, how did this discussion help you to understand the relationship between hashtag social order and urbanization? We've seen throughout history that a lot of like the ways in which cities were developed had something to do with the needs and the shape of the certain type of populations that were existing at that time.\n",
      " and in the proposals of urban development we can see what sort of like the visions the leader had and what problems they were dealing with. Like if we're talking about Ebenezer Harvey was imagining green self-contained communities, you can think of that as an alternative to polluted industrial cities and you can sort of see like the way the leaders were thinking, the way they could sort of imagine like you know climate, health crisis and everything like you know going on in the forward and you can see like\n",
      " you know, sort of, you know, their frame of mind. So this just basically tells us, like, you know, how the viewers viewed the people, what they viewed the problems as having being, and how, like, you know, further down the line they were actually thinking about how these problems could emerge. Yeah, great. And there's a way in which that first part of the LO description, so different forms of thought, in the case of urban planning, I mean, they're literally being used as tools to order society, right? The ways that...\n",
      " neighborhoods get torn down, new, more, you know, modern, rational construction gets, or urban projects get put in. Elena, anything else you'd add about this relationship between hashtag social order and urbanization? I think Julia is a great example, and thanks for those who have taught me about her now, and about her, yeah, about how it's so easy to exclude or include.\n",
      " people within the social order of the actual urbanization movement. So she of course advocated for people to not exclude people in the slums and actually consider people on the outskirts of the city. And yeah, it's really easy. Like you said, they're literally creating the social order. So I guess just building more specifically on that. Yeah. Okay, good. All right. Iris, break time. Digging into the vault here.\n",
      " I don't say I don't know if I've played this since first semester MC, so it's been a while\n",

      " and then in the debrief you'll share the image and we'll have a chance to talk through why it is there isn't a good site ways we can deepen that reading also consider the linkages you see between the sites your group selects and the readings that we just discussed\n",
      " I'm actually a bit confused about the LBA. You mentioned like a website. I clicked into it, but I didn't understand how we should, how should our LBA be related to the website? I think the website is like a, I don't know, some sort of interactive map or I don't know, interactive map, but it's a way.\n",
      " where you can see the story behind certain like historical places so I guess the LBA one of the parts is you go to this website and contribute to it by adding an entry about the place you chose and then you need to write the formal like analysis as a report that was submitted. So it's like a shorter version of like our essay we should put into the website.\n",
      " side as a contribution. Okay, got it. Thank you.\n",
      " you\n",
      " you\n",
      " Do you guys have any ideas for the buildings that you guys might use for LVA? I mean, you can start by showing yours when we go in order. Yeah, I mean, I didn't find a specific one, but what I was thinking is like...\n",
      " I was talking to the Pablo, the massage guy in VA, and he was explaining how there is, like, in VA, there is, like, European-style, like, very expensive and Gothic and, like, very old-style, very expensive buildings. And then there's also, like, Argentine traditional-style buildings. And, like, so I was thinking how I, I was thinking of picking one of those, like, European-style buildings in one of those,\n",
      " district and explain how it kind of overrides the local building culture and it kind of becomes like like a stand more standard like if it doesn't meet the standard then it doesn't look good it doesn't fit into the landscape of the area.\n",
      " Yeah, in my case, I selected the Chinatown, the Dragon Gate that is here like five minutes from the rest. So it's like... I didn't know about the Dragon Gate.\n",
      " Yeah, so the Dragon Gate, like in Chinatown, is one of the oldest and largest, like, outside Asia. Information from Chattopadhyay, the pre-classwork. So it's blending, like, Chinese culture elements with, like, American Uber life. And about, like, the localization aspect, at the district, it maintains, like, the Chin-\n",
      " Chinese traditions while like adapting to Western influences as well. So you can see like bilingual signs, different cuisines all together and also the architecture like style so have like a blend of the Chinese culture and the American culture like in the same neighborhood.\n",
      " Okay, so I picked, I mean I'm not entirely set with this idea, but I picked the Palacio de Aguas Calientes here in Buenos Aires, which used to be a former like waterworks building and it was constructed in between 1888 and 1894. And I think it's a good example of localization of Buenos Aires because it describes the like\n",
      " like ornate European with an ERO and eclectic styles that were popular in the 19th century. And I think it's particularly interesting because it's used to serve like local needs for it being like the waterworks building, but then it was recontextualized as a cultural landmark. And yeah, that's pretty much it.\n",
      " As for me, I have two places on my list. I haven't decided which one I would go for.\n",
      " so I would either want to talk about the Golden Gate Bridge and how that's related to the international trade happening in the West Coast or I could potentially talk about the Painted Ladies and expand a little bit more about the style of the architecture. So yeah, haven't decided which one I would go for.\n",
      " I think it would be interesting.\n",
      " from the lessons that we're looking at today, it would be interesting to consider the context in which this place is built and like think about the city planning to see how relevant it was this particular building in the context of the late 1800s or the very early 1900s and see how that related to how people lived in Buenos Aires. So that's like one of the things that I could use from the\n",
      " today's screenings to analyze and contextualize this more.\n",
      " Is there anything from the class today that could be used to analyze some of the things that you guys have been researching for the LBA?\n",
      " Yeah, I was just thinking how might Remington's money thingy could be relevant, because I think we see some very expensive buildings around here, but I haven't really researched if it comes from Remington's money or just people who just made\n",
      " money here and then just try to sound fancy, make fancy buildings. I think that's very interesting. I'm curious to know where, like it's not real for me to guess where the like most money would be flowing to or from it from like the European, from Europe to\n",
      " uh which place did you pick sorry again yeah i was planning to pick somewhere close to palermo the buildings but i'm not sure the exact building okay so i'm curious to know where like remington's money is flowing more to if from here to europe or from europe to here do you know you have any info about that\n",
      " I'm wondering if you have information regarding where money is flowing more, if Remington's money is going mostly from here to Europe or is coming from Europe to Buenos Aires? No, I haven't searched about it and that's what I want to search after this class, yeah.\n",
      " I think Sherry was trying to say something, I cut it off. Yeah, no worries. I was just thinking of the, when we were discussing the rise of the city, probably that can also connect to what I want to talk about the trade history of San Francisco, because trade is an important element.\n",
      " we are discussing the rise of 3D. So yeah, just a small thought. I think we need to pick one now. I vote for Cherry's idea.\n",
      " You\n",
      " Okay, if a person from each group could go ahead and upload the image that you focus most on. I want all of us to think about how you can apply the methods of hashtag localization that you hear about here to your own site and actually to that end.\n",
      " So this is harder to do in breakout, but I'll do it now. I'm going to go ahead and actually put the rubric for globalization on screen in just a sec. So feel free, even if your group didn't end up selecting your site, to bring your site in as a comparison to the ones that we are focused on.\n",
      " Sorry about that. All right, a little blurry, I'll zoom out. All right, there's our rubric for localization that I think we can make effective reference to. So, Carl, whose site got selected for your group? Hello? Okay. Hello? \n",
      " was mine then this is the Balacluta in San Francisco and we just really thought that ship is like the best epitome epitome of localization because of how you could already from just you know without even without the photo just thinking about the ship itself we could already ask questions like what goods did it transfer and\n",
      " and who did it transfer, what ideologies did it transfer, you know, in a very similar manner on how the Silk Road sort of amplified or like spread religions across its travelers, because this ship started and was made in Scotland and how it ended up in San Francisco could be a whole another story. But then we thought that this ship is just really a global connector and then the whole.\n",
      " typical explanations of how it embodies like global trade networks in local port cities, and the ship itself is the connection point between the global and the local. Okay, that's a really interesting argument. What, I guess, what are some other ways, and this is a question for everyone else, some other ways we could start thinking about this site?\n",
      " this object as from local perspectives. Yeah, Jules. Oh, I mean, like, I kind of like, I didn't get, like, what it was sort of like a foreign ship that just, like, was anchored or, like, anchored in San Francisco at some point, but I was thinking perhaps also, like, the process of how it was built and, like, the materials that were used, I guess, more on a global level, though. But, like, perhaps sort of, like, also, who was involved in, like, building it?\n",
      " like sort of like what does it tell us about like the social order, perhaps of the place, like what kind of goods was it like made to transport, made for transport, and so on. Yeah, I love all these points, particularly the way you brought in a hashtag social order as well. Okay.\n",
      " Yeah, I can't hear him either. Okay. All right. So I think, you know, it's a. All right, Carl, I think you're reloaded. Go ahead. Yep. Oh, perfect. So what I heard last was like, you sort of wanted a more solid example of localization. That's what I heard.\n",
      " Well, I was asking about sort of other local readings of this site, of this place, but go ahead with your thought, because it sounded like it was going somewhere interesting. Hello, hello. Yep. Sorry about that. Oh, no, I can't hear anyone. See you on Greenbluff, but I can't hear it, so I'm going to assume you guys hear me.\n",
      " So one other example I could bring in that I'm kind of excited for actually was when we look back to our previous classes when we talked about like the growth of coffee and so consider like how the demand of coffee in Europe and America led to the growth of coffee plantations in Brazil and so we could even think of like the shift like the Malcosta being involved in transporting that coffee which then makes a direct link between Brazilian economy\n",
      " to global markets like San Francisco and then if we even look even like zoom in a bit you can see how it impacts the port cities in both ends and the ship of Theseus comes into mind because like imagine the Balcluta needing repairs in a port in South America so who knows local shipwrights might using local timber and their woodworking expertise and tools would be really important to get the ship back in shape so that it could go back to transit.\n",
      " transporting goods again, so it really, on a more literal and concrete level, shows the globalization aspect of it, because not only does it transfer goods, but also transfers expertise on maybe the next shipwright might notice that, huh, this type of architecture or this type of fix is different, this type of wood splicing is different, I wonder which technique this ship got it from.\n",
      " All right. Thanks for your patience. Thanks for that take, Carl. Okay. So, I think one question I have here is, it came up in Carl's comments.\n",
      " which it relates to the port cities themselves. So Sherry, how might we tell a local story of this, not the ship, but the city of San Francisco through this ship? I think we can treat the light ship as a basis and trying to contextualize the history context at the moment\n",
      " So, for example, I'm thinking of the international trade that can possibly happen when the sheep is butched, and how does the trade contribute to the rise of San Francisco, their local economies, and also how the, potentially talking about the laborers market and the employment regarding international trade that can be related to the sheep.\n",
      " Good. Ellen, how about more related to the topic of today's conversation, sort of urban development, the history of the city of San Francisco. Those were all excellent points. I just want to try to have us think more about urbanization relative to the ship. If you think of it, like if you think particularly in the context of San Francisco, we can\n",
      " look at San Francisco's evolution as a port city by looking at the gold rush and how it disappeared this massive immigration and trade wave and with that of course we can explore how the wave of immigrants influenced and fused with the local traditions that are seen in the art and how that in turn affected the urban space and architecture so\n",
      " I don't know, I'm a bit of a nerd in terms of ports so we can look at the different configurations for the docks and the modern mix use of the places where the ships, I don't know the word in English, but the ships dock to the port and how all of this serve as a way to meet the local needs. \n",
      " and all the changes with the immigration and the different needs that the locals were having in terms of culture, economy, and importing goods. Yeah, great. So, one story we could tell here is what did the port of San Francisco, what did the city of San Francisco look like in the year or the decade that the ship was built, right? And then what changes happened over the life of the ship? You know, maybe...\n",
      " said it was built in Scotland, maybe it didn't visit San Francisco for 30 years. So during that time period, what are some global processes we could point to? And then local modifications that were made in San Francisco, either because of the nature of the port, the risk of earthquakes, the Great Fire, et cetera. These are all potential readings. All right. All right. Robson, we've got another obviously San Francisco icon.\n",
      " for your group, so why don't you, even if it wasn't your site, go ahead and walk us through how the GoldenGate bridge can be begun to, how we can begin to understand it from a global lens. Okay, we didn't discuss much about GoldenGate, just mentioned, but like\n",
      " The Golden Gate represents a global engineering and expertise blend with San Francisco general identity. So far as I know, it was designed by international engineers. It integrates architectures with modern infrastructures. It also has a global recognition, like attracting millions of tourists globally, shaping.\n",
      " like local businesses, so everyone goes to that specific area because of the Golden Gate. And the Golden Gate today, like it symbolizes like a global innovation symbol influencing like the general landmark, merging like technology advancement with like cultural significances. And in the past, it was like built during the Golden Age.\n",
      " So when everyone was like coming to San Francisco because of like the gold rush. So it had like a really important process like in the economic development in the area. Well, if we're thinking from a history of city one perspective, you know, it's like a sense, almost not quite a century removed from the height of the gold rush. But we can think about sort of\n",
      " subsequent gold rushes to San Francisco, the growth of the city in the 20th century. I can also nerd out about this one because when I came to graduation last year, I brought my kid, my uncle took us to see the bridge because my older daughter had just done a school project on the Golden Gate Bridge. So we did all the walkarounds. If you haven't gone up close and seen the exhibits, seen the insides, all the way they splice all the cables.\n",
      " together. It is. It is pretty cool. All right. So let's think about this from the perspective of the readings that we did today. Alina, what might be some stories that we can or broader global trends in urbanization that we could connect the bridge to? Of course, rising technology and trade are essential.\n",
      " but also expansion, like rise in population. I think that this bridge connects like kind of a suburb to the main city downtown. So it could be, and this is often used for commuting. So it could be also like increase in population. Yeah, that story of sort of urban spread or suburbanization. But maybe we'd have to be careful with causing\n",
      " there, right? It's not necessarily the bridge was led to suburbanization so much as suburbanization like repurposed the bridge, right? A couple different ways we could think about this history. Great, all right. So Hillary, what do you think is particularly beneficial about trying to take a historical perspective on the development?\n",
      " of these first two sites? Like, how does it help us think about San Francisco differently? So I think if we just like look into San Francisco or even before taking this class, I would just maybe like, oh, analyze what is this ship? Like, what's like the history of this ship or like, like how the gate, like the bridge is built. But I think with this like historical approach, we.\n",
      " we have like like when we analyze it we we try to like remember like to look into the connection between like how the local influence the global level and or how like global events influence like the local events so I think that that shows like that shows more like a comprehensive picture and I think it also like demonstrates some like the hidden causality that\n",
      " we might not have pay attention before. Yeah, nice. Yeah, great job bringing in one of the five C's at the end there. I think that can be a really good approach to applying hashtag localization in reference to these sites. All right, let's come to group three. I'm a big ice cream fan, so I'm excited to hear about it.\n",
      " this one. Yeah, Alayna. Yeah, for group D that's a picture of my dinner last night. This ice cream store has basically stayed the same since the 70s. So I want to analyze it but I thought originally it could be interesting to analyze the shop as it's like that's probably one of the most unique features is that the design of the shop is\n",
      " quite old school. It's even used for music videos to be like a vintage place, whatever. But actually, I decided I think globalization connects better to the actual ice cream, which is found all over Argentina. So I'll just do a general analysis of Argentinian ice cream as a globalization concept. Because, well, I can describe globalization now. However, yeah, so I think that Argentinian ice cream was born from Italian gelato.\n",
      " and Argentina of course experienced a large huge range of Italian immigration but also now Argentinian ice cream has become a thing of its own it has quite different texture Jules even says it's better than Italian gelato I think it has a slightly higher fat content I think it's more whipped but not as much as American ice cream and now it has a international following like there's Argentinian ice cream shops in Washington DC\n",
      " Jules's mom also buys Argentinian ice cream in Germany, so that's kind of the local-to-global connection as well. Okay, cool. Why don't we take a moment to read through the rubric for localization. Feel free to mark it up, annotate any pieces.\n",
      " that stand out to you and put up a check when you have something you'd like to that you think is helpful for thinking about any of our three case studies here or other examples of potential LBA sites that your group discussed.\n",
      " Yeah, Jules, go ahead. Wait, what's the question about, like, any other examples? Yeah, if you can connect, if there's sort of pieces of the rubric that stand out to you and you have any other examples for sites that could further either help us think about the three that we focused on or elements of the rubric. Go ahead, Jules. Yeah. \n",
      " I don't know who underlined it, but I think the mutually impacting relationship is really, really important. So, for example, I think something we pointed out in the breakout for Elena's side, for the ice cream, it's not only that she looks at it in a one-sided way and sort of sees how Argentinian helados are derived from Italian ice cream.\n",
      " also think about sort of like how now ice cream like helps to further like the Argentinian economy and I think that same goes for like for example like the like the Golden Gate Bridge like think about it as not only like a place that sort of like brings the local of like San Francisco like as a symbol of the local San Francisco to the world but also think about like how the world sort of like\n",
      " impacted, like the Golden Gate Bridge, like where did the materials come from, like where was the architect, like from like a local architect or like some from another place, like yeah. Good, yeah, and I think these points tied nicely into what Robson was also lining up for the bridge, so thank you.\n",
      " about local identity as a key feature in this local relationship. All right, any other thoughts about the rubric? Jules, go ahead. Sorry, I was taking time. I'm trying to take my hand down again. I thought, I knew you had other thoughts about the assignment. I have another thought, but not about it.\n",
      " Okay, we'll come back to you, Alan. I mean it's I think it's very obvious but the rubric is overemphasizing the mutually impacting part, so I guess it's a good application of localization would very detailly explore how the local impacts the global and vice versa, not just\n",
      " is one directional, but needs to show his bi-directionality. Yes, and that was a real strength of our conversations about this LO at the beginning of the semester. So I'm glad you brought our attention back to it now. Carl? Fine, just going on the fire. One thing that I think helps me think about approaching profound knowledge if we ever get there.\n",
      " is remembering this code on how if we can only bend the rules if we know them in the first place and what I mean by this is I'm referencing um Conrad's what makes a good historical question like that's Colin not Conrad for what it's worth but keep going sorry Colin the open-ended the relevant uh I'm gonna paste them in the chat but I was thinking that and it's\n",
      " also a mini-question if that's one way to think about it, whether, like, if we can apply this good historical question since it's more hashtag globalization, but since, like, with the aforementioned quote, I was wondering if that could be a good connection to make for in approaching and thinking about approaching a five-level assignment? Yeah, I think...\n",
      " just in general, thinking across linking across readings in that way in this course, bringing unexpected concepts from from one area of the course to another is generally a good is is one potential pathway towards a five level application, not just on this hello, but other L. O. S. And I think, you know, these points that have come up about the specific examples we have before\n",
      " in terms of thinking about, you know, the materials, the consequences for identity that folks have been emphasizing. These are all really valuable pieces of the story. I mean, one other way, like if I were to maybe try to think about the ice cream example even more, cattle obviously have such a central role in, I shouldn't say obviously, cattle have a central role in Argentine history.\n",
      " So what does it tell us? That it's sort of, you know, the source, where is the milk coming from? How does that fit into the story? Is it, you know, how local is it from what part of the country is it coming? That might be a story about urban, excuse me, rural to urban linkages that would fit nicely in today's story, or excuse me, fit.\n",
      " that kind of rural to urban linkage fits nicely within the larger story that we've been telling today. All right, Jules, did you want to come back in with a question about the assignment? Yeah, I was wondering, like, I know that you don't mind so much if we, like, take another, like, take aside from the history pin thing again, and sort of, like, if we give it a spin, what I was thinking of, perhaps we could have a spreadsheet or something, where, like,\n",
      " I think the largest group, for example, is from BA here, so that we don't have any doublings on our sites, but I don't know if that's something you care about, but I don't know. I mean, I'm not particularly gun-shy about it, like I'm not worried about it, in other words. It's never been an issue before, but it's something I'll talk to Ola about and get a sense from her, since she's not only taken...\n",
      " in class but has now TA'd it for several semesters, she might have a better sense of sort of how this might shake out. So I appreciate, appreciate the question. All right. So, I mean, the the sites that we've, no I don't actually want to come to the last question I wanted to ask. Put up a hand if you, you picked another potential site for your...\n",
      " LBA that you think doing a comparison between that site and the three that we focused on here would be beneficial. All right Jules. Yeah I'm actually not I think I'm not gonna do it in the end. I think I'm gonna like focus on the Obelisk score instead because I couldn't I couldn't believe it but no one picked it for history opinion so I was like okay I'm gonna do that but there's\n",
      " It's a place called Palazzo Barolo, and if anyone wants to focus on that thing from the BA people, I have useful resources to share, so you can happily take that idea from me. It's built by an Italian immigrant as well, in Buenos Aires, and it sort of shows the rise of the Italian influence and of the Italian elite.\n",
      " And so I think that would be sort of like interesting to see in connection to the ice cream example. Because it's connected to sort of like the wave between 1850 and 1950 of Italian immigration of Buenos Aires. Cool. All right. Thanks for the tip, Adam. Mine was about the, like, proclaimed...\n",
      " founder of Buenos Aires, and he has a statue in Santiago, which has origins to who had this place has origins, relations to the origins of the city. And the statue is him shown in a heroic pose. And behind him is an indigenous people, but she is portrayed.\n",
      " as a savage, and I wanted to seek if that's something that can be considered on the globalized side, because technically, these are the colonizers who came in and brought their image of the indigenous people, but yeah, I don't know. Yeah, what are some potential ways we could...\n",
      " look at this monument, understand a monument from a global perspective. Anyone have any thoughts on this? Maybe not specifically the one Adam is talking about, the obelisk in BA, which Jules has brought up in the chat. How could we read this from a global perspective? Jules?\n",
      " I mean, I can talk about what I thought about doing in my assignment. So I think for the one direction, global to local, I was thinking that obelisks are a thing around the world. I think the one built in BA is one of the newest or most recent ones. So I was thinking one of the things, one of the directions I can imagine going into, sort of think about how it's different.\n",
      " from different obelisks and also how, perhaps, the significance of obelisks has changed across time because I think the way they were used, for example, in the ancient times in Egypt and so on, it's very different from how they're used nowadays and the meanings they carry. And then I was also thinking, for the local global, how...\n",
      " that's like a symbol for Buenos Aires or has become like a symbol of like, so like I have like one of a secondary source that says the obelisk in Buenos Aires is like the Eiffel Tower in Paris or like the, not the big bend, Tower Bridge in London. So like how it's become sort of like the thing like the thing that represents Buenos Aires. And I think\n",
      " I don't know if that's already a five-level application, but I think I'm also going to talk about sort of like the social connections and how they've shaped sort of like the significance of the Obelisk on Leica. Yeah, I think thinking about those social meanings, and again this question of identity that's come up a couple times, is a good way to think about the LO. All right, so to kind of wrap up, the sites that we've been looking at, you know, aren't necessarily\n",
      " examples of the built environment, but how do you think we could connect the readings that we, or the concepts that we looked at in the first part of class to the case studies from the second part of class? Like how did, how did those readings from the first part of class help us to contextualize and compare these LBA sites? Yeah, so like, I think like,\n",
      " If it's examples with San Francisco, I think we can talk about how it caters to the elements, to SF being like a city, like a center city where people commute to, or all of the resources are gathered. And for example, with the ship example, we can talk about how it acts as a global city.\n",
      " compared to the city because it touched on the transnational elements of a trade between each city and how it may be like, maybe the trade between like transnational trade and how it may be like spread around the U.S. to help to act as a hub for trade and like commercial commerce and economics. Yeah, great, Alan.\n",
      " I think I wanted to touch on a different aspect of urban build environments, particularly on like city planning and for instance here in Buenos Aires, I think the city planning and the way the cities were built was very purposeful in the sense that all of the entities of power were built or concentrated in the same.\n",
      " area and if you look at the streets they're like very aligned with like if you are in Diopolis, there is a direct line of sight with the Casa Rosada, the government palace aligned in the center and then you can see how this established some sort of social order where you see all the core of the city encompass all of the power structures and you can see the most like the unprivileged or the place where the poor immigrants moved to Buenos Aires.\n",
      " live are often either surrounding the port or train stations so one of the most important or economically in the lower spectrum communities here in Buenos Aires is literally going has a railroad going between it so I wanted to connect the point between Buenos Aires in particular and our city planning and we've\n",
      " of urban Americans. Good. I mean you could even pick a building in the Tenderloin for this and talk about sort of urban preservation movements and the ways in which like this older, looking at change over time, the way certain kinds of architecture, certain districts get repurposed. I think that would be an interesting approach to the LPA as well. All right, so to wrap up today, how might...\n",
      " a lesson from one of the readings. Further the analysis in terms of glocalization or hashtag social order. I think both Takaya and Ellen's points point us in potential directions here.\n",
      " you\n",
      " you\n",
      " you\n",

      " One more minute.\n",
      " you\n",
      " All right, Sherry, what's your takeaway from that?\n",
      " this session in terms of how it might change the way that you think about the urban environments in which you've lived during your time at Minerva? So this is not related to the LBA, it's more about the Minerva experience. Okay, so I think this kind of provided me with a lot of tours where, say, frameworks. When I think about the urban development...\n",
      " of the Minerva rotation city. So for example, we're going to Taipei next semester, probably we can look at how the technology works there, how the trade relations with other regions works there. So I think that will be interesting to have a more systematic way when we're thinking of the urban development of the city.\n",
      " Yeah and we might come back here as well to that point about imperialism that came up or colonialism that came up at the beginning of class right and sort of looking maybe looking at thinking about the ways the Japanese occupation shaped shaped elements of the city's design. Alright, nice job today. This is a fun fun session.\n",
      " Qingyun, I have a source for you about Chinatown, but it's going to take me a second to find it. So have a good weekend, hopefully getting feedback on the primary source analysis to very shortly in the next couple of days, but look forward to seeing you Tuesday. Thank you. \n",
      " Okay, never mind, I had a question, but I lost it just now, so, Carl, go ahead. Yeah, this is a really good one. This is like a consistency prof that the whole reason it came back to us off the margin. Oh, froze for me. I have my question now. It's like, walking through those. Yeah, yeah.\n",
      " Why don't you ask while he reloads? Any focuses? Anything you want to focus on? Sorry, nope. That would be beneficial for the next assembly? Carl, sorry. You're going to have to start all over again. Oh, no. The reason you came back to San Francisco, and then you cut out. Can you hear me now? Yes. So the reason I came back.\n",
      " to San Francisco was because I got a scholarship to attend the game dev conference which is happening next week and what that means is because I also have like a paid volunteering role there I am gonna commit 100% to be there which means I can't attend classes for next week so it's also it's like a sort of courtesy for you to know and my follow-up question was also is there anything that you want me to\n",
      " focus on in the next two classes when I review the recording so that it may be, it may benefit me in my, like, assignment? In the question, what to talk about in the assignment? Advice, yes, I think so. I, I appreciate this. I think the next couple sessions are, particularly next Thursday's session, are helpful in.\n",
      " terms of thinking about hashtag social order differently. But I think given. We got cut off from the set, particularly next Thursday. Next Thursday for thinking about hashtag social order. But that's not sort of the direction your site is headed in for the LBA. So.\n",
      " Don't be too Yeah, if anything else occurs to me, I will I will let you know I mean, I think kind of I think you will enjoy you would have enjoyed Tuesday's session in particular. So We're sorry to miss you next week, but I hope you have a great time All right\n",
      " Yeah, I'm just worried about centering my source. Like my lesson from last assignment, well, I learned so many things about writing a history essay. It's why it took me so long. I had to re-learn all of it. But yeah, no, my, I realized that like at the beginning, my primary source was a bit kind of pushed to the side. I was referencing it, but I was more so doing like history before and after. So I'm worried about this again. If I would focus more on like.\n",
      " Argentinian ice cream in general, how can I still center my store as a primary source? Is that a concern for you as well? Yeah, that's a great question and it was sort of something I was thinking about. Is the store... So you talked about sort of this vintage look that it has, that part of it is why it's attractive more broadly. Yeah. \n",
      " can you tie sort of that aesthetic, the building's history, to a specific moment in Argentina's history, right? Yeah. So you don't have to answer that now, but another way to think about this is, is it in like a historically, well, I mean like this may be a dumb question because it's Argentina or in Buenos Aires.\n",
      " but like, is it not in a historically Italian neighborhood? Like, wouldn't it be funny if the building were in like a different segment of the, like sector of the city? So you see like the ways in which, what we associate now with gelato, the sort of, you know, the Italian influences, there's actually like disjunctures in time and space between, between.\n",
      " the two? That would be the site. I think we're in a historically Lebanese neighborhood, actually, like my great grandfather went to school right next to us at the summer. So there's like a lot of Lebanese families living here. But um, so yeah, I guess I could connect with that. That's a good idea, like connected to why was there in the 70s. This like Italian gelato in a Lebanese neighborhood. That's a good one.\n",
      " Yeah, but also the, yeah, I think the history of the place is interesting, like the, of course, the parents of the owner was, they both immigrated from Italy, but like the same place in Italy. So deep connection to Italian culture, so I was just thinking to like incorporate the specific history of this store with like the general history of Angelato. Yeah. So I'm giving away a lot of potential here, but one way to connect.\n",
      " it to the readings for today is the way in which this deeper history of immigration gets flattened by a history like by capitalism right and by a certain kind of capitalist development and projection of a certain Argentinian identity that may look superficially similar to previous kinds of Italian influence but actually is very different.\n",
      " Like, imagine you're from the U.S., so I feel comfortable talking about this, like, you're writing a global history of Chobani yogurt, right? Which is made in Minnesota, I think, somewhere in the upper Midwest, and you're connecting it to, I don't know, the Wisconsin dairy industry over time.\n",
      " Do you know what the wrinkle is here? Chobani's Greek? It's owned by a Kurdish guy, actually. Right, okay. Right, so there's a way in which sort of these, again, like on the surface, there might be one sort of seemingly straightforward story, but actually if we look underneath the glow.\n",
      " context and connections are much more complicated than that. And you're not gonna find this in every site, but the fact you know enough to know about the Lebanese, like, neighborhood, that's cool. But why is it replaced by a flattened capitalism? Like, for what benefit? Because I know there was a lot of erasure of, like, for example, if I ask, like, family friends, I'll be...\n",
      " be like, hey, what's like the descent of your son and like your family? Are you guys Lebanese, Italian, just because it interests me? And they're like, no, he's Argentinian. My son is like 100% Argentinian. So is that kind of what you're referring to? Yeah. So the ways, I mean, we could look at it from a historicity. Maybe the framing of my text of my chat comment was more historicity one.\n",
      " more at historicity too, right? So like the underlying history, there may be more continuities than maybe changes too, but they're just presented differently at the level of narrative. If that makes sense. Okay, awesome. I'll keep thinking about this and I'll come to you if I have more questions. Thank you for helping me with this concern. Great. I am jealous about it.\n",
      " the ice cream hey Adam thank you for saying after class I just wanted to kind of ask about the dead bedroom them and those are like that statue I've made like some arguments why this can be\n",
      " a good site for the LBA, one of them is that this is, it represents the Spanish conquest of the Rio de la Plata in Buenos Aires, established in Buenos Aires, it reflects how global historical forces, the Spanish colonization, European expansion shaped the local landscapes of Latin America and the presence of this indigenous…\n",
      " figure behind him I think maybe like signifies how others are perceiving the local culture which maybe I can make the argument that this is like the global forces aspect that I can dive deeper into my assignment in but I'm worried that this shows like global influence\n",
      " right but it doesn't fully embody a blending of local and global countries because it feels like it's it's a it's a it's it reinforces the top-down colonial perspective rather than like a mutual exchange right right so one question can you put the name of the well actually hold on\n",
      " of the statue? Yeah, the name of the statue? There. All right, okay. So I think these are all good points, but here's where sort of going into more, like thinking about the statue, the monument itself and its history.\n",
      " Oh, terrible Wikipedia entry. So oh, okay, okay.\n",
